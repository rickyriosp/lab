# Problem 4

# Problem 4-1
# 10.0/10.0 points (graded)
# You are given the following function and class and function specifications 
# for the two coding problems on this page (also available in this file, die.py):

# Write a function called makeHistogram(values, numBins, xLabel, yLabel, title=None),
# with the following specification:

# Paste your entire function (including the definition) in the box.

# Restrictions:
# - Do not paste import pylab in the box.
# - You should only be using the pylab.hist, pylab.title, pylab.xlabel, pylab.ylabel, 
#   pylab.show functions from the pylab module.
# - Do not leave any debugging print statements when you paste your code in the box.
