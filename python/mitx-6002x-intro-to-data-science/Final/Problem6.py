# Problem 6
# 20.0/20.0 points (graded)
# Write a function that meets the specifications below. You do not have to use dynamic programming.

# Hint: You might want to use bin() on an int to get a string, get rid of the first two characters,
# add leading 0's as needed, and then convert it to a numpy array of ints. Type help(bin) in the console.

# For example,
# If choices = [1,2,2,3] and total = 4 you should return either [0 1 1 0] or [1 0 0 1]
# If choices = [1,1,3,5,3] and total = 5 you should return [0 0 0 1 0]
# If choices = [1,1,1,9] and total = 4 you should return [1 1 1 0]
# More specifically, write a function that meets the specifications below:

# Paste your entire function (including the definition) in the box.

# Note: If you want to use numpy arrays, you should add the following 3 lines before your code:

# import os
# os.environ["OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"
# import numpy as np

# And use np.METHOD_NAME in your code. Unfortunately, pylab does not work with the grader.
